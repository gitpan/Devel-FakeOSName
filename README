NAME
    Devel::FakeOSName - Make Perl think it runs on a different OS

SYNOPSIS
      # build us Makefile for aix
      perl -MDevel::FakeOSName=aix Makefile.PL

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes your code includes code specific to an OS that you don't have
    an access to, but you want to see what happens if it was to run on that
    other OS.

    Currently mostly useful for looking at generated Makefiles. Needs much
    more work to be really useful.

TODO
    Currently the module just modifies $^O and $Config{osname}. Could
    probably somehow supply overrides for other %Config::Config values and
    ExtUtils::Embed.

    Patches are welcome.
